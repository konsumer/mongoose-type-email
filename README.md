## usage

This will validate email, correctly:

```
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
require('mongoose-type-email')(mongoose);

var UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    email: {
        work: mongoose.SchemaTypes.Email,
        home: mongoose.SchemaTypes.Email
    }
});
```

You can also use the stuff in `String` type:

```javascript
var UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    email: {
        work: {type: mongoose.SchemaTypes.Email, required: true},
        home: {type: mongoose.SchemaTypes.Email, required: true},
    }
});
```

You can also use it as an array:


```javascript
var UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    emails: [{type: mongoose.SchemaTypes.Email}]
});
```
